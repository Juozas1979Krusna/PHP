This repository is aimed to save my PHP programming language training code examples to assist recruiters obtain understanding what kind of programming language topics I went through already. I presume the content will be impressive soon despite its current state. :) Each book, a tutorial source for me, is represented here by it directory named "BookXY". A part "...XY..." means a book I work on serial number. Each directory here represents some topic and is named like that "BookXY_Pabc. A name part "..._Pabc" stands for a page "abc" in considered book where a topic code could be found. The book name and link to download it (only legal sources will be represented there, if you find some illegal action there just report that to me and I will take adequate means) is in a project description. Each "BookXY_Pabc" directory contains all necessary code for one separated project (some programming language topic) to be run on machine where these file would be downloaded and compiled (speaking in general). Database description could be found below.
